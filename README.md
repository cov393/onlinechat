## Description:

The web application is a chat platform that allows users to create and join chat rooms. The application is built using Node.js and utilizes the Express framework to handle HTTP requests and responses.

When a user visits the application, they are presented with a landing page that allows them to create a new chat room by entering a unique room name. Once a room is created, the user is redirected to the chat room interface, where they can send and receive messages in real-time. The user can also invite friends to join the chat room by sharing the room's name.

The chat room interface consists of a simple design that displays the room name, a list of messages, and a form for sending new messages. The application allows users to send text messages, as well as images and links. The messages are displayed in real-time as they are sent, creating a seamless chatting experience for users.

Overall, this chat platform is a great way for users to connect with their friends in real-time, regardless of their physical location. The easy-to-use interface and real-time messaging capabilities make it a valuable tool for anyone looking to stay connected with their friends and colleagues.
